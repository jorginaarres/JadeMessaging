Agent Systems and Applications Homework, delivery 2

There are three Agents: Client, RestaurantGatekeeper and RestaurantManager.
Client asks (request) RestaurantGatekeeper if it is possible to book a table for dinner for 2 person for specific day and time. RestaurantGatekeeper asks RestaurantManager
if it is possible. RestaurantManager "checks" availability (generates random answer) and send information to RestaurantGatekeeper.
RestaurantGatekeeper give the answer to Client. In case if the resevation is possible, Client confirms it (by sending appropriate message to 
RestaurantGatekeepe).
Code this scenario, using appropriate communication acts (see presentation JADE:messaging)
